<h2 class="SectionTitle">Download and Install</h2>
<div>
Chor can be installed as a standard Eclipse Plugin, through the Eclipse Marketplace or directly through our update site.
You will need the Xtext framework installed as a prerequisite (find and install it from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">here</a>).
If you want to execute the projected Jolie programs, you will need to <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/">install the Jolie language</a>
<br/>
If, instead, you are interested in developing Chor, you can run and debug it using the source code from our repository directly.

<h3 class="SectionSubTitle">Eclipse Marketplace</h3>
Chor is listed in the Eclipse Marketplace: <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/chor">http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/chor</a>.
<br/>
If you have the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mpc/">Marketplace Client</a> installed in Eclipse, you can simply download it from there searching for "Chor".
<br/>
Or, simply drag this button on your Eclipse workspace to start installing it:
<a href='http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=338814' title='Drag and drop into a running Eclipse Indigo workspace to install Chor'>
	<img src='http://marketplace.eclipse.org/misc/installbutton.png'/>
</a>

<h3 class="SectionSubTitle">Eclipse Update Site</h3>
Alternatively, from the Help -> Install new software... menu in Eclipse, you can use our update site: <span style="font-family: monospace">http://eclipse-site.chor-lang.org/</span>

<h3 class="SectionSubTitle">Running from Source code (for developers)</h3>
If you want to develop the Chor plugin, you can download its source code from our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/chor/code/">code repository</a>
and then run the <span style="font-family:monospace">chor.ui</span> project.
